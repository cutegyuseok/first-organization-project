## Optimal play

Optimal play for 2-player Pig was computed by Todd W. Neller[5] and visualized by Clifton G. M. Presser in 2001.[6] At any time, the relevant decision information includes the player's score, the opponent's score, and the turn total. Such information corresponds to a 3D point in the graph's space. If this point is inside the gray solid, the player should roll. Otherwise, the player should hold.

Many 2-dice variants have been analysed,[7] and human-playable Pig strategies have been compared to optimal play.[8] For example:
-'Hold at 20' is a popular strategy. Each turn, the player rolls until they score 20 or more, then holds. This strategy has a 8% disadvantage against optimal play.
-'Hold at 25' was found to be more effective.[who?] This has a 4.2% disadvantage against optimal play.
-'4 scoring turns' holds at 25 on the first turn, then on subsequent turns divides the amount needed to reach 100 by the number of turns remaining. This has a 3.3% disadvantage against optimal play.
-'End race or keep pace'. If either player has a score of 71 or higher, roll to win. Otherwise, hold on 21 plus the difference between scores divided by 8. This has a 0.9% disadvantage against optimal play.
